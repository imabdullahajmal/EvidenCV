# Resume Builder App

A dynamic resume builder app that allows users to input details via a text prompt, generate a preview in HTML, and download the resume as a PDF. The app uses an API to process the text input and generate the corresponding resume data, with an option to download the final resume in PDF format.

## Features

- **Text Input for Resume Data**: Users input resume details as a prompt.
- **Resume Preview**: Once the data is processed, the app generates a preview of the resume in HTML format.
- **PDF Generation**: Users can download the resume as a PDF.
- **React + TailwindCSS**: Frontend built using React and styled with TailwindCSS.
- **Backend API**: Backend server powered by Node.js and Express to handle PDF conversion and data processing.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **API for PDF Generation**: Third-party PDF generation API
- **CORS**: To enable communication between frontend and backend running on different ports

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or Yarn)
- Ensure that you have a working API key for PDF generation and replace it in the backend code.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-builder.git
cd resume-builder
````

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Frontend (React):

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Backend (Node.js):

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 3. Set up environment variables

In your backend folder, create a `.env` file and add your API keys:

```env
PDF_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Make sure to replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key for the PDF generation service.

### 4. Run the application

#### Frontend:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder (if not already in it):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your React frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Backend:

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder (if not already in it):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Start the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 5. Open the application

Once both servers are running, open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to use the resume builder app.

## Usage

1. **Input Resume Data**: Enter your resume details (name, email, phone, skills, education, etc.) into the text prompt.
2. **Preview**: Click on the "Generate Preview" button to generate a resume preview.
3. **Download**: If satisfied with the preview, click on the "Download PDF" button to get your resume in PDF format.

## CORS Setup

Since the frontend and backend run on different ports, the backend has been configured with CORS to allow requests from the frontend. The CORS configuration is set up using the `cors` package in the backend.

### Example CORS configuration in the backend:

```js
import cors from 'cors';

app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:5173', // Frontend URL
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
}));
```

## API Endpoints

* `POST /api/generate-resume`: Sends resume data as JSON and receives a resume preview in HTML format.
* `POST /api/generate-pdf`: Sends HTML data to the PDF generation service and returns a PDF file.

## Folder Structure

```
/backend
  /controllers    - Handles API routes and logic
  /services       - Contains service files like PDF generation
  /routes         - API route handlers
  server.js       - Express server setup

/frontend
  /src
    /components   - React components for the UI
    App.js        - Main React component
    index.js      - React entry point
  tailwind.config.js - Tailwind CSS configuration
  package.json    - React project dependencies
```
